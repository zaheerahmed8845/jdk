Private Methods in Interface:
-----------------------------
Evolution of Interface in Java

1. In Java 7 - interfaces had only public abstract methods.
2. In Java 8 - default methods where introduced where if an implementation is not provided for the method then default
   method is executed.
3. In Java 9 - Private methods are introduced, to avoid duplicate code. These are implicitly static.
