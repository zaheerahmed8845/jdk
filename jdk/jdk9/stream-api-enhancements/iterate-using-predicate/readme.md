Stream Iterate Using Predicate
------------------------------
**In Java8**

1. The Stream Iterate method was introduced in Java8.
2. The limit was based on the number rather than the value produced.

**In Java9**

1. Starting Java9 with the introduction of takeWhile this could be resolved as the limit is on the value produced.
2. This was further simplified by introducing the predicate method.
3. The Stream Iterator can be a replacement for for-loop as for-loop is an imperative style of programming whereas the
   Stream Iterator is a Functional Style of Programming.
