TakeWhile - DropWhile:
----------------------
Pre-requisite:The list needs to be sorted for both.

**Take While**

1. If the condition returns true, then it will take the element or else will break.
2. TakeWhile is similar to limit. The difference is TakeWhile takes an input of type predicate but whereas limit takes
   an input of type long.

**Drop While**

1. If the condition returns true, then it will drop the element or else will break.
2. DropWhile is similar to skip. The difference is DropWhile takes an input of type predicate but whereas skip takes an
   input of type long.
